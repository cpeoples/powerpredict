# PowerPredict

PowerPredict employs TensorFlow to implement a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for the purpose of generating Powerball and Megamillions lottery numbers. The LSTM, a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), possesses the ability to learn and predict by considering long-term dependencies. This characteristic renders it potentially well-suited for time series prediction.

## How to Install and Run Locally

#### Python Installation

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

#### Alias

```bash
alias python=python3
alias pip=pip3
```

#### Setup Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cpeoples/powerpredict.git
cd powerpredict
python -m venv powerpredict
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Execute

```bash
python main.py megamillions
python main.py powerball
```

The model will print predicted Powerball or Megamillions numbers.
